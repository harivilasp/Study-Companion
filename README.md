# Study-Companion

## Main Idea
**Study Companion** helps you get instant web resources and video explanations for any question or problemâ€”just by taking a screenshot or uploading an image. The app extracts text from your image, summarizes it, and fetches the most relevant web pages and YouTube videos to clarify your doubts.

## How It Works
1. **Have a Doubt or Need Clarification?**
2. **Take a Screenshot/Snap** of the question or problem.
3. **Upload the Image** (or paste the text) in the web app.
4. The app performs **OCR** to extract text from the image.
5. **Text Summarization** distills the main point.
6. The app suggests **related web pages** and **video explanations**.
